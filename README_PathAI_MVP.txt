   pip install streamlit pillow matplotlib numpy
2. Run the app:
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
3. The app will open on http://localhost:8501 (or the URL printed by Streamlit).

How to deploy on Streamlit Cloud (shareable link):
1. Create a GitHub repository and push the files in this package.
2. Log in to Streamlit Cloud (https://streamlit.io/cloud) with your GitHub account.
3. Create a new app and point it to the repository and the streamlit_app.py file.
4. Deploy â€” Streamlit Cloud will give you a public URL.

Notes:
- This is a demo MVP using a simple heuristic for image highlighting. It is intended for demonstration and early user testing only, not for clinical diagnosis.
- If you want a hosted/shared link and prefer, I can prepare a ready-to-push Git repo structure (including a requirements.txt) for you to upload to GitHub.
